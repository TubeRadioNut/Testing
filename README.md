Scenario 1: Vehicle Management

The Problem: Let's say you're working on software for a car dealership or a traffic simulation system. You need a way to digitally represent different kinds of vehicles.
Questions to Guide Students:
What pieces of information are absolutely essential to describe any vehicle, regardless of its type? (Examples: make, model, year, perhaps color)
Are there pieces of information that are important for some vehicles, but not all? (Example: number of doors is important for cars, but not motorcycles)
What actions or behaviors might a vehicle need to perform in a simulation? (Example: start, stop, turn)
